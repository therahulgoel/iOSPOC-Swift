/*
 Backtracking is an algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time,
 removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.
 
 These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once.
 
 Its an optimization over iterative solution as instead of generating all possible solutions first and then look for solution,
 we try eevry solution one by one untill we find the working one.
